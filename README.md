# MVCCryptoStats is created to monitor the changes happening to all the crypto coins returned from the Wazrix API call. The price change is compared in real time at an interval of 30 seconds and the coins with change greater than 3% is displayed. This output can be used to determine the possible pump for a specific crypto coin and deciding in which coin to invest to get maximum return in a short period of time.
